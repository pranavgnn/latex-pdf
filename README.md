Helper project for an upcoming project.

A dockerized sandbox API to create LaTeX PDFs.

For API reference (I mean, it just has one route lol), you can run the project locally and head over to `/reference` (powered by Scalar).

Or if you want OpenAPI docs in JSON, you can just head over to `/docs`.

To install dependencies:

```sh
bun install
```

To run:

```sh
bun run dev
```

(Sorry I am too lazy to write this README)
